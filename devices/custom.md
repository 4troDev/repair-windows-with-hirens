## ‚öôÔ∏è BIOS Settings to Check

Sometimes custom PCs require a few BIOS changes to allow booting from Hiren‚Äôs:

1. Power on your PC and enter the BIOS using the key for your board (see above).
2. Look for these settings:
   - **Secure Boot** ‚Üí **Disable**
   - **CSM (Compatibility Support Module)** ‚Üí **Enable**
   - **Legacy USB Boot** or **Boot Mode** ‚Üí Set to **Legacy** or **Both**
3. Save and exit (`F10` on most BIOS).

If you're using **UEFI only** mode (common on newer builds), use **GPT + FAT32** when creating your USB with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie).
